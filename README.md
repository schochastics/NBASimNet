# NBASimNet

NBASimNet is a shiny app that lets you explore similarities of NBA players since 1990.
The app is based on a series of blog posts on *Analyzing NBA player data*:

- [Scraping NBA player statistics](http://blog.schochastics.net/post/analyzing-nba-player-data-i-getting-data/)
- [Clustering NBA players](http://blog.schochastics.net/post/analyzing-nba-player-data-ii-clustering/)
- [NBA similarity networks](http://blog.schochastics.net/post/analyzing-nba-player-data-iii-similarity-networks/)

Run the app with `shiny::runGitHub("schochastics/NBASimNet")`
make sure you have the package `visNetwork` installed.
